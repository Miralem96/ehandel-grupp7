We were sitting all together when it was time for us to merge all the branches to main and when everyones functions and code were added in to the correct files and notebooks.

How to run:

1. Open the project in VS Code or Jupyter.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. In the terminal, install the packages:
   pip install -r src/requirements.txt

4. Open notebooks/report.ipynb and run all cells to see the results and charts.
5. You can also test functions by running files inside the src folder, for example:
   python src/metrics.py / python3 src/metric.py
